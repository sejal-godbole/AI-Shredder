# 🛡️AI Shredder & Redaction Tool

## Overview
The **AI Shredder & Redaction Tool** is an AI-powered application designed to automatically detect, redact, and anonymize sensitive information from documents and images. It provides a secure and efficient solution for privacy compliance, sensitive data protection, and document management.

This tool is particularly useful for organizations handling confidential data such as legal documents, financial records, medical reports, and scanned images.

## Features
- **Automatic Redaction**: Detects sensitive text and images to redact using AI-based models.
- **Supports Multiple Formats**: Works on PDFs, images (JPEG, PNG), and scanned documents.
- **Customizable Rules**: Users can define which types of information to redact (e.g., names, addresses, IDs).
- **Batch Processing**: Redact multiple documents/images at once.
- **Preview Before Redaction**: Allows users to review detected sensitive areas before final processing.

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `PyTorch`: For AI model development.
  - `transformers`: NLP model handling for sensitive text detection.
  - `PIL (Pillow)`: Image processing.
  - `opencv-python`: Image and PDF processing.
  - `json`: Storing and exporting metadata.
  - `dataclasses`: Handling structured data for detected information.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
